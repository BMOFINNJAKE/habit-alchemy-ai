// lib/constants.ts

// Define any constants that are needed throughout the application.
// This file should NOT contain any constants related to Boosters, Automation, or Integration.

// Example:
export const APP_NAME = "My Application"

export const SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = [
  { code: "en", name: "English" },
  { code: "es", name: "Spanish" },
]

export const DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = "en"

// Add more constants as needed.
